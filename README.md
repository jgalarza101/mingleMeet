Simple Mobile Friendly Dating Web App

MingleMeet is a web-based application that is based on dating websites. This dating website in particular lets users navigate through other users in a modern Pinterest-like fashion. The logged-in user can see other registered users quick profile in a card like fashion. By clicking on the card of another registered user, you bring up the modal for more of their information besides their location, name, and age. The cards also has three buttons that consist of a like/unlike button (used for matching purposes), messaging button, and a report user button. A user can currently send a message to another registered user, but only if they like them first. If a user keeps spamming messages to another user, the annoyed user can report that user. If both users 'like' each other, then they are considered matched.
There are three tabs in the user's homepage: the home tab, which lists all the registered users on the dating site; the messages tab, which shows all the messages the logged-in user currently is involved in; and the matches tab, which shows all the registered users that either have matched with the logged-in user, were 'liked' by the registered user, or 'liked' the registered user and are awaiting a response. By streamlining the process of matching people, users can be at ease in trying to find a person to be with.
